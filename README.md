# JavaFxTestAssignment

This is a simple JavaFX app that was built as a homework assignment for "Advanced Object Oriented Programming."

It represents a College Catalog system, allowing the user to enter the availible classes, save them, then bring them back up.

I copied over the source code into a new JavaFx app project in intellij and it ran. I have not improved my code in anyway so its very much at a second-year-rushed-homework-assignment level of quality. Enjoy.
